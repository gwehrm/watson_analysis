# watson_analysis

The purpose of this repository is to just try and play a bit with different models and deep learning!

the main dataset used for all these analyses is obtained (crawled) from the swiss news website watson.ch. 

So far, this repository contains:

* Classifier.ipynb - A tagger for the german language - obtained from from https://github.com/ptnplanet/NLTK-Contributions/blob/master/ClassifierBasedGermanTagger/ClassifierBasedGermanTagger.py

* Text TF.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with Classification using Tensorflow

* journalist_identification.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with data prep and classification using Naive Bayes. 

* watson_crawler.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with the crawler used to get the data from watson.ch

* word2vec - Jupyter Notebook with some Natural Language Processing

* RNN - Jupyter Notebook with a Recurrent Neural Network
